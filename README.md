# Video2FramePics_with_GUI
I write this program due to a personal experience.  
When firstly knowing about the field of CNN, I ask an elder student about what should I do if I want to enter this field. He told me the very first step is to transfer video to frame pictures. At first, I was confused, I think such a simple step can be done by using a very simple program: 1.choose the video file; 2.choose the path of output; 3.click <code>Transfer</code> to finish this task. But when I tried to find such a program on the Internet, nothing found. All I can see are unfamiliar codes and codes around everywhere.
Now, after a period of learning, I have gained the ability of writing such a program, so I did it. I hope this program can help those who like the very first me.

**The README will be detailed, more information about the program will be added into here later.**

## 1.GUI  
* I use tkinter to make this GUI.
* Tkinter is not very convenient (But very useful)
* More parameters can be put into this GUI, that's this project's future direction.

## 2.Video to pictures
* I use package <code>cv2</code> to complete this important step. The code in Python is much shorter than in OpenCV.
